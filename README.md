# TIMESTAMP

Hi team , hear I have developed Timestamp project , in that we have to find out the simultaneous call with exact time so
we have manifold scenarios

such as , there are multiple start timestamp with exact time , in that scenario , if new timestamp is
different from the previous during that time, we received response as minumum time for ending timestamp or new start timestamp.
it depends on sitution.

Here , it log file is empty so will return as empty file message

if data is mismatch with the inproper signature , during that time we received response as data corrupted.

Here , I have also developed insert method in the log file , but you can change directly in log.txt.


for insertion : http://localhost:5000/
for getresponse with maximum number of simultaneous calls :  http://localhost:5000/
we recieve response with the latest maximum number of simultaneous calls
